# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications simple and efficient. In this post, we'll explore how to set up a Next.js project from scratch and dive into some of its key features.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides a structure and features for your React applications, including:

- Server-side rendering and static site generation
- Automatic code splitting
- Simple page-based routing
- API routes
- Built-in CSS and Sass support

## Setting Up Your First Next.js Project

Let's start by creating a new Next.js application. You'll need Node.js installed on your machine.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js project and start the development server. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your application.

## Creating Pages

In Next.js, pages are React components exported from files in the pages directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its filename.

For example, to create a page that renders at the /about route, create a file at pages/about.js:

```jsx
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>This is the about page of our Next.js application.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Dynamic Routes

Next.js supports dynamic routes through files with square brackets. For example, a file named [id].js in the pages directory will match routes like /1, /2, etc.

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function Post() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Post {id}</h1>
      <p>This is the content of post {id}.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js provides a powerful set of features that make building React applications easier and more efficient. This introduction just scratches the surface of what's possible with Next.js. In future posts, we'll explore more advanced features like API routes, static site generation, and deployment options.
